Feedback from Part 1

After submitting Part 2, I received feedback suggesting that I should:
– Make each dish stand out more on the Home Screen by placing them in clearer, separate blocks for easier readability.
– Review my Filter Screen, as it appeared there were two filter screens, which caused confusion in the design flow.


POE Changelog

This POE focused on the design and development of a mobile application for a chef named Christoffelsand his restaurant. The purpose of the application is to allow the chef to add the dishes he creates, while also enabling users to browse and filter through various dishes according to their preferences. The project aimed to deliver a clean, intuitive, and visually appealing interface that enhances both functionality and user experience.

Changelog – Part 2 (16–19 October 2025)
During Part 2 of my POE, I implemented several design and functionality enhancements to improve the overall usability and visual appeal of my application:

– Added images for each course meal, which were not included in the initial wireframes.

– Introduced course cards, with each card displaying the dish name, price, category, description, and image for better organization and presentation.

– Implemented a “Remove” button beneath each meal, enabling users to delete dishes from the menu.

– Updated the header to include a “Total Dishes” indicator that dynamically displays the total number of dishes available.

– Added a “+ Add Dish” button at the bottom of the screen to allow users to conveniently add new dishes.

– On the Create Dish screen, replaced the original dropdown menu used for selecting a course with a scrollable selector, providing a smoother and more intuitive selection process.

– Modified the dish creation workflow by replacing the textbox (used in the wireframes for adding a dish) with a “Save Dish” button, which automatically saves and adds the new dish to the menu.

– Applied a consistent solid background color in place of an image background to improve readability and make text and cards stand out more clearly.

Feedback from Part 1

For Part 1 of my POE, I received full marks, and therefore no additional feedback was provided.

Changelog – Final POE (9–12 November 2025)
In my final POE submission, I made further refinements to enhance both the functionality and user experience of my application:

– Added average price displays for each meal at the top of the page, allowing users to view the average cost per meal category.

– Introduced a filter feature, enabling users to filter dishes according to their preferences a feature that was not added in Part 2.

– Included a “Filter” button on the Home screen to provide easy access to the new filtering functionality.

– Adjusted the layout and design by reducing the size of the “+ Add Dish” button and positioning both the “+ Add Dish” and “Filter” buttons in the top-right corner of the screen to create a cleaner and more balanced interface

– I changed the background color of the application to a more burgandy color, that was kept consistent accross all screens.

– In the Filter Screen I added a feature that shows the heading and how many dishes is explame, for 'The Mains 3'.
